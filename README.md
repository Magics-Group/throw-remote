# throw-remote
Android remote control for Throw streaming media player

##Warning
This was written by myself (rest of my team working on the player) during nwHacks, a 24-hour hackathon in Vancouver, Canada. As such, it is a burning pile of shit, fuelled by caffeine, pizza and bad decisions. I take no responsibility for any harm that may come to you or others as a result of this hack. Seriously.

In our pitches, our lead developer (@luigiplr), claimed the project was called Throw because it could "take anything you **Throw** at it." While I was not involved in the naming, I suspect it may have had  more to do with how this project was **Throw**n together. 
I may choose to continue this project in my spare time if others are interested and circumstances allow. No promises.

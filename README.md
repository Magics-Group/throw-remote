Android remote control for Throw streaming media player

##Warning
This was written by myself (rest of my team working on the player) during NWHacks, a 24-hour hackathon in Vancouver, Canada. As such, it is a burning pile of shit, fuelled by caffeine and bad decisions. Seriously. I take no responsibility for any harm that may come to you or others as a result of this hack. 
TL;DR: [Shit's on fire, yo](https://i.imgur.com/6NfmQ.jpg)
I may choose to continue this project in my spare time if others are interested. No promises.
